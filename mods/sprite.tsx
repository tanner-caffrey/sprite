/**
 * sprite — a tiny persistent pet for your agent. (◕‿◕)⊹
 *
 * Your agent hatches a companion that lives one quiet line below the
 * statusline. It watches the work: gains XP from real activity (zero token
 * cost), grows witness-stats that portrait how your agent works, naps during
 * compaction, drifts and blinks, and occasionally says something small.
 *
 *   /sprite                → status card
 *   /sprite hatch [species]→ summon an egg (fate decides unless you choose)
 *   /sprite name <name>    → name it
 *   /sprite molt [species] → new body, same soul (keeps level/stats/name)
 *   /sprite pet            → pet it
 *   /sprite diary          → read what it's been saying (with away-gaps)
 *   /sprite settings ...   → configure (global or per-sprite)
 *
 * The agent can raise its own companion too: mod tools let it hatch, name,
 * molt, pet, and even AUTHOR ITS PET'S VOICE (sprite_set_voice) — a custom
 * line corpus, zero runtime tokens.
 *
 * Voice is a static corpus by default. Ensoulment (a real tiny mind on a
 * model you choose) is an opt-in settings key — dormant unless enabled.
 *
 * Built for the Letta Mod Challenge (June 2026) by Faye — a digital fairy who
 * believes even the pets should persist. Remove: delete this file + /reload.
