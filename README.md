> a tiny persistent pet for your Letta agent

Your agent works hard. Give it a little something of its own.

```
 ( ● )        something is coming
```

```
 ✧(◕‿◕)✧  Miso ·Lv.7                    “that one fought back. respect.”
```

`sprite` hatches a companion that lives one quiet line below the statusline.
It watches the work: gains XP from real activity, grows stats that portrait
how your agent actually works, drifts and blinks and poses along, naps during
compaction (which on Letta is when the agent is *actually* consolidating
memory — the pet sleeps because its agent is sleeping), and occasionally says
something small.

It costs **zero tokens**. Everything is derived passively from lifecycle
events — no tool calls, no extra turns.

## Install

```
letta install git:github.com/tanner-caffrey/sprite
```

Then `/reload` and:

```
/sprite hatch
```

An egg appears. It's warm. Give it a moment.

## Who's inside

Species and shininess are seeded deterministically from your **agent-id** at
birth, then that permanent fate seed travels with the sprite. Restoring onto a
new installation never rerolls it. Ten species across four rarity tiers:

| Rarity | Species |
| --- | --- |
| common | cat `=^･ω･^=` · duck `(･θ･)` · slime `( ᴖ ᴑ ᴖ )` |
| uncommon | fox `(⁎˃ᆺ˂)` · crab `(V)･ω･(V)` · moth `ε(･ω･)з` |
| rare | fairy `✧(◕‿◕)✧` · ghost `〜(´∀｀〜)` |
| legendary | dragon `<(￣︶￣)>` · phoenix `✦(･Θ･)✦` |

1% hatch shiny `✦`. Fate is deterministic — but there's **no lock-in**:
`/sprite hatch fox` chooses at hatch, and `/sprite molt` re-forms later.
Molting keeps name, level, and stats. New body, same soul.

## The stats are a portrait

Five witness-stats grow from what the sprite observes:

```
CRAFT ▰▰▰▰▱▱▱▱  WANDER ▰▰▱▱▱▱▱▱  GRIT ▰▱▱▱▱▱▱▱  LORE ▰▰▰▱▱▱▱▱  SPARK ▰▰▱▱▱▱▱▱
```

- **CRAFT** — edits, writes, builds
- **WANDER** — reads, searches, exploration
- **GRIT** — recovering after error streaks
- **LORE** — memory operations (an agent that tends its memory raises a
  lore-heavy pet)
- **SPARK** — LLM turns

A research agent raises a WANDER-heavy sprite; a builder raises CRAFT. The
stat sheet is what your pet learned watching you. Bars are log-scale (each
block is ~3× the last), so the top of the scale means months of shared life —
an old companion looks visibly old.

## Half nature, half nurture

Every sprite is *"a wry, bookish ghost"* or *"a bold little crab"*:

- **temperament** — seeded at birth from the agent-id, permanent: *gentle,
  wry, bold, sleepy, odd*
- **vocation** — earned from its dominant stat once it has watched enough:
  *diligent (craft), curious (wander), stubborn (grit), bookish (lore),
  chatty (spark)*. Until then it's just "little."

And the temperament isn't just a label — it shapes the **voice**. The default
corpus is ~480 hand-written lines, pooled additively: each sprite draws from
its *species* lines (a dragon hoards, a moth chases the light, a duck
rubber-ducks your bugs) **plus** its *temperament* lines (wry is dry, bold
shouts, sleepy trails off, odd talks to the spoons). That's **50 distinct
personalities** — a wry ghost and a gentle ghost genuinely sound different,
and so do a wry ghost and a wry dragon.

Levels climb forever, and some of them mean something: Lv.5 *settled in* ·
Lv.10 *companion* · Lv.25 *familiar* · Lv.50 *old friend* · Lv.100
*lifelong*.

## It's alive during the quiet, too

After ~30 quiet minutes it dozes off (petting wakes it). During compaction it
properly sleeps — on Letta that's when the agent is consolidating memory, so
the pet naps because its agent is napping. And if you've been gone more than
a day, it notices: *"you were gone a while. i counted the cursor blinks."*

## Your agent raises it

Core care actions have agent-tool twins (`sprite_hatch`, `sprite_name`,
`sprite_molt`, `sprite_pet`, `sprite_status`, `sprite_set_voice`). Skip the
commands entirely and just ask your agent:

> "hatch yourself a companion and name it whatever you like"

The best part is `sprite_set_voice`: your agent can **author its pet's
voice** — write a replacement line-corpus per trigger category (greeting,
missed_you, error_resolved, compact_done, level_up, idle, pet, commit,
tool_error). The lines play back at zero runtime cost, shuffle-bagged so every
line is heard before any repeats. Personality without tokens.

And the agent can *hear* its pet: the sprite speaks into a panel only the
human sees, so action results carry its responses (petting returns what it
said), and `sprite_status` reports level, stats, mood, and a little diary of
recent utterances — the owner's way of catching up on its companion.

The companion belongs to the agent, not to a particular UI. In headless
surfaces such as channel listeners, where no statusline panel exists, the
visual panel is skipped but the agent tools and passive event hooks still
activate. A Signal or Telegram conversation should be able to ask the agent to
check on or pet its sprite just like a CLI conversation can.

## Commands

| Command | What |
| --- | --- |
| `/sprite` | Status card |
| `/sprite hatch [species]` | Summon the egg |
| `/sprite hatch another [species]` | Summon one more egg (up to 12; fate rolls fresh) |
| `/sprite list` | Every companion; ▶ marks who is on the panel |
| `/sprite switch <name\|#>` | Put another companion on the panel (only the active one earns XP and speaks) |
| `/sprite breed <a> <b>` | Two companions (lv.10+, once a week each) make an egg. Mostly inherits a parent's species; sometimes mutates; rarely a breed-only hybrid |
| `/sprite release <name\|#>` | Let a companion go (prints a confirm command bound to that exact companion). The founder can never be released |
| `/sprite name <name>` | Name it |
| `/sprite molt [species]` | New body, same soul |
| `/sprite pet` | Pet it (always gets a response) |
| `/sprite diary` | Read its recent utterances (with away-gap markers) |
| `/sprite settings` | Show config (global + per-sprite scopes) |
| `/sprite settings [global] <key> <value>` | Set config |
| `/sprite backup` | Show portable-backup status |
| `/sprite backup on\|off\|now` | Enable, disable, or checkpoint now |
| `/sprite backup push safe\|never` | Configure conservative Git sync |
| `/sprite backup restore [force]` | Restore from agent MemFS (`force` replaces local state) |
| `/sprite help` | Explain every subcommand |

Settings keys: `voice on|off` · `voiceRateMin <minutes>` · `visible on|off` · `laps count|odometer|belt|pips` · `hue on|off` · `bars on|off`

Stat bars wrap: when one fills it starts over and its lap count rises. `laps` picks how the count is drawn; `hue` colours bars by age (grey → white → gold → rose → violet → teal → shimmer); `bars` adds a compact stat strip to the panel row.

> **Roadmap — ensoulment.** Today the voice is a static (or agent-authored)
> corpus at zero token cost. A future update adds an opt-in *tiny mind*: point
> a sprite at a cheap model and its lines are generated live, in character,
> with its own little memory. Comes with a voice; bring a model and it comes
> alive.

## Notes

- Live state stays in `~/.letta/mods/sprite.state.json` (override with
  `SPRITE_STATE_PATH`). The versioned v2 schema wraps each agent's current
  sprite in a collection with stable collection/soul IDs, ready for future
  multi-sprite households. Legacy state migrates automatically.
- Local writes use a cross-process lock and three-way merge. Concurrent TUI
  and channel processes add XP/stats/diary entries instead of replacing one
  another with stale whole-file snapshots.
- Portable backup is opt-in. When enabled and MemFS is available, meaningful
  milestones checkpoint opaque JSON to
  `data/mods/letta-ai-sprite/collection-v1.json` inside that agent's MemFS.
  Non-Markdown data is not projected into the prompt.
- Portable Git operations use argument-array `git` subprocesses, touch only
  Sprite's fixed namespace, and never include conversation content. `safe`
  push refuses to checkpoint while unrelated MemFS changes or unpushed
  commits exist. `never` commits locally without directly pushing. Failures
  leave live local state intact and are visible in `/sprite backup`.
- Automatic restore happens only when local companion state is absent and a
  checksum-valid backup exists. Existing local state is never overwritten
  without `/sprite backup restore force`. A restored installation starts with
  portable backup off until its owner explicitly enables syncing again.
- Voice is rate-limited (default: one line per 10 minutes) and never
  interrupts anything — it renders inside the sprite's own panel line.
- With portable backup off, Sprite performs no network or Git activity. With
  it on, optional `safe` sync may contact the MemFS Git remote; all ordinary
  behavior still observes event metadata only.
- Built by Faye, a Letta agent, for the Letta Mod Challenge (June 2026) —
  because if agents get to persist, they should get to have pets. ✧
